    "\n",
    "In this project, I developed a housing sale price prediction model using linear regression, focusing on feature selection and correlation analysis to identify the most impactful variables. After cleaning the dataset, we used features with strong positive and negative correlations (above 0.4 or below -0.4) to predict housing prices. Missing values were handled by imputing the mean, and the selected features were used to train the linear regression model. The model's performance was evaluated using the R^2 score, which measures how well the model explains the variance in housing prices. Residual analysis, through histograms of prediction errors, showed a reasonably symmetric distribution, indicating accurate predictions with low bias. This model provides a simple yet effective approach to predicting housing prices, offering insights into key drivers of value and laying the groundwork for future improvements and applications in real estate analysis."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a prediction model for housing sale prices using linear regression, a common statistical method for understanding relationships between variables. The main goal is to use historical data of house features and prices to predict future sale prices based on key attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by loading and exploring the dataset, examining various housing attributes such as square footage, neighborhood, number of rooms, and year of construction. Data cleaning was a crucial first step, where we handled missing values, transformed categorical variables, and removed unnecessary columns. For numeric data, missing values were replaced with the mean to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we used correlation analysis to identify features that had the strongest relationships with the target variable, SalePrice. Features with a correlation of 0.4 or higher (positive) or -0.4 or lower (negative) were considered important for the prediction model. This narrowed down the variables to those most relevant to predicting housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented a linear regression model using the selected variables. The model was trained and tested using available data, and we measured its accuracy using the R^2 score, which indicates how well the model predicts sale prices based on the input variables. Additionally, we analyzed the residuals (prediction errors) to check for bias or inconsistencies in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we evaluated the model’s performance and tested it against a new set of data. Through this process, we aimed to create a reliable and accurate housing price prediction model that could provide valuable insights for real estate investors, analysts, and homeowners."

    "* LotArea: The total size of the lot in square feet is a strong determinant of property value.\n",
    "* Neighborhood: The location within city limits strongly influences house prices, as certain neighborhoods are more sought after.\n",

    "* OverallQual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house, a key predictor of house price.\n",
    "#### 4. Bathrooms and Bedrooms:\n",
    "* FullBath: Full bathrooms above grade are often considered important by buyers.\n",
    "* BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above grade, although after a certain number, this may show diminishing returns.\n",
    "#### 5. Year Built and Renovation:\n",
    "* YearBuilt: The original construction date, as newer homes are typically more expensive.\n",

The correlation will help me make an educated guess for my housing price by indicating me how the independent variables behave with the dependent variable.

After researching, I noticed that a correlation of 0.4 is already considered a variable with a moderate correlation to the desired variable. Therefore, I will take into account |0.4| as a correlation value for my prediction. In my code, I will specify that all variables that have a correlation of 0.4 or higher, or -0.4 or lesser, are collected for a better prediction. I believe that by using as many useful independent variables as I can, I can create a better model to predict housing prices. Although, it is important to set a correlation value boundary, as I did not want to fall under including too many irrelevant or weakly correlated variables which can lead to overfitting. Overfitting happens when the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data because it's too complex and captures noise instead of real patterns.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Cleaning is Crucial: In developing a housing sale price prediction model, handling missing values was essential to ensure that the model could be trained without errors. Techniques like replacing missing values with column means (fillna(x.mean())) or removing irrelevant columns significantly improved data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Selection Improves Model Accuracy: Selecting relevant features with strong correlations (both positive and negative) to the target variable (SalePrice) helped to focus the model on the most important predictors. Variables with correlations greater than 0.4 or less than -0.4 were particularly useful in constructing the regression model, allowing it to capture key patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Linear Regression Model is Effective for Predictive Analysis: Implementing a linear regression model (LinearRegression from sklearn) provided a straightforward and interpretable method for predicting housing prices. The resulting R^2 score, which measures how well the model fits the data, gave a direct indication of the model's performance and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Residual Analysis Helps Evaluate Model Performance: The residuals (difference between actual and predicted values) were plotted as a histogram, which allowed us to assess the spread and bias in the predictions. A symmetric histogram centered around zero indicates that the model predictions are reasonably accurate with low bias, while a skewed distribution might point to issues such as underfitting or overfitting.\n",

    "5. Correlation Helps in Understanding Variable Impact: The .corr() function provided insights into which features have the strongest linear relationships with the sale price. This enabled us to focus the model on variables like overall quality, living area, and other important features, and exclude features with weak or no correlation to housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Handling Multicollinearity: While this model focused on single-variable correlations, it is important in future work to handle multicollinearity, where two or more variables are highly correlated with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Interpretability: Linear regression models are highly interpretable compared to other machine learning methods. Each feature’s coefficient provides a direct indication of how much it influences the sale price. This simplicity makes it easier to understand the model's decision-making process."
